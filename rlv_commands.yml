  description: |
      Allow/prevent always running.<br>
      When prevented, the user is unable to switch running mode on by pressing Ctrl-R. If you want to prevent the user from running at all, you must also use @temprun. This command is useful when you want to force the user to accelerate before running, rather than running all the time, for example during combats or sports games.

      Get the name of the active group.<br>
      Makes the viewer automatically answer the name of the currently active group, immediately on the chat channel number <channel_number> that the script can listen to. Always use a non-zero integer. Remember that regular viewers do not answer anything at all so remove the listener after a timeout. The answer will simply be "none" if no group is active at the time.
  syntax: "@getgroup=<channel>"

     Please note that there is no way to obtain the UUID of the group, only the name.

- command: version
  type: reply
  description: Returns the RLV and RLVa version that the viewer is using on the specified channel.
  syntax: "@version=<channel>"
  output: |
     RestrainedLife viewer v4.0.0 (RLVa 3.0.0)
  notes: |
     This was the original command for retrieving the RLV version, but it's now deprecated due to restrictions on using Linden Lab-owned
     trademarks by external parties. While it remains functional for compatibility, it's recommended that new scripts use @versionnew instead.
