     RestrainedLife viewer v4.0.0 (RLVa 3.0.0)
  notes: | 
     This was the original command for retrieving the RLV version, but it's now deprecated due to restrictions on using Linden Lab-owned
     trademarks by external parties. While it remains functional for compatibility, it's recommended that new scripts use @versionnew instead.
