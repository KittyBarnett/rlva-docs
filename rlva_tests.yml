  title: If RLV is disabled then logging in, performing everyday actions and closing the viewer should not trigger an assertion failure.
  preconditions:
    - The `RestrainedLove` debug setting was set to `FALSE` at the log-in screen.
    - The user is logged into Second Life.
  test_steps:
    - step_number: 1
      action: Perform some regular actions such as switching outfits, teleporting, editing an object, ...
    - step_number: 2
      action: Close the viewer
  expected_result: |
    The viewer should close as normal with no error messages displayed.
  notes: |
    If RLV code runs without the appropriate 'is enabled' checks, eventually an instance of RlvHandler will be created which will trigger
    an assertion when the viewer is closed.
